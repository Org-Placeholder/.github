## Hey there!ðŸ‘‹
This is **Placeholder Organization**.
And before you ask why "Placeholder", we couldn't think of a better name and were overjoyed when we saw that the name "Org-Placeholder" was available.
## What is this?
This org basically houses all the group projects and group assignments given to us as part of our coursework. 
The [Documents](https://github.com/Org-Placeholder/Documents) repository has most of the reports, etc submitted as part of these projects.
Feel free to have a look around! :smile:
